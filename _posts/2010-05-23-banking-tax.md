When we are coming across many bank failure worldwide, the fear of declaring bankruptcy by many more is haunting everyone. I could observe the urgency shown in the recent meeting at Busan in North Korea port city by the G 20 nations to discipline the various countries to ensure a healthy and strong financial system.

The matter of introducing the Bank Tax was discussed as a tool to avoid the collapse of banks in the future. Countries like the USA and Europe proposed such bank tax to develop a buffer to meet out any bank bail out in the future. This fund will help the banks in distress to meet their capital requirement and also to ensure better liquidity at the time of crisis.

In fact, as I have my own reservation on such a move, few of the countries comprised under BRIC rightly expressed their reservation to go in for bank tax as the regulatory system in their countries, do not warrant such introduction. Though the critics comment that such opposition as a &#8220;short sightedness&#8221; the developing countries are not willing for such proposal.

An ongoing financial structural system with proper regulatory control is expected to put the banks on a healthy track without the need for such taxing reforms.
