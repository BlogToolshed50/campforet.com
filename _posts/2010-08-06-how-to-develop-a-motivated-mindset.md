Baby Steps &#8211; Sometimes the hardest part is actually getting started. A project seems so monstrous that we cringe at the thought of all that time and energy we&#8217;ll have to expend. Instead of overwhelming yourself, start small. Set a timer for 15 minutes and just start working on it. Allow yourself to stop after 15 minutes if you really want to. But most often, once we actually start working on something, we won&#8217;t want to stop. Don&#8217;t focus on the big picture, look at the smaller details and take them on one at a time. Any large task seems manageable once we break it down into smaller steps.

Care of the Body &#8211; Sometimes our feelings of fatigue are caused by physical deficiencies, not mental. Be sure you are getting enough rest, eating food that nourishes your body, drinking enough water, getting enough exercise, etc. Especially when we&#8217;re very busy, we tend to grab the quickest, easiest meals, which aren&#8217;t always the best choice for our bodies. Eating a lot of highly processed foods and sugar is like putting watered-down gasoline into our cars. In order for our cars to run smoothly, we need to maintain them properly, and so it is with our bodies also. Remember, the body is the vehicle for the mind and soul!  <img src='http://www.campforet.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />

Remember to reward yourself from time to time, and be gentle with yourself! There will always be things that &#8220;need&#8221; to be done. But some of us take on way more than we can handle, and our lives turn into a pit of drudgery because of it. Try to eliminate the things that truly don&#8217;t bring you joy, or at least minimize the time you spend on them. Do what you can, and let the rest go. Or ask for help. Don&#8217;t feel you have to do everything yourself.

Remember that motivation, just like happiness, is something we choose. We may need to give ourselves a little push at the beginning, but once we get into the right mindset, it&#8217;s simple to stay there if we choose to.
