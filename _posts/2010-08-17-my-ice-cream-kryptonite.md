My drive home from high school took me by a little diner that had a lot of great flavors of ice cream. It was too tempting most days and I stopped there to get some quite often. Most of the time I got a flavor called Superman that’s neon rainbow and is supposedly just vanilla flavor with different colors. But I swear it tastes differently.

That flavor isn’t as popular as its supposed counterpart, so I can’t find it that often where I live now. There isn’t a shortage of ice cream shops, any search on wild blue satellite tv will prove that, but unfortunately a lot of those shops are small and don’t list flavors on their websites.

That’s why it’s been such a hassle to track down which ones have it. But when I find ones that I do have it, I make sure to comment on their websites or user reviews with my wild blue internet Kansas that they do have it.

I’ve finally tracked down a few that have the Superman flavor, but I know there have to be others out there like me that love the flavor and have the same trouble finding it.
