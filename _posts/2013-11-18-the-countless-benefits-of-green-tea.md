Research into weight loss aids and supplements have always left me curious about the many benefits of green tea dieting. In this article I hope to mention some of the main benefits of green tea dieting. Although it’s not a diet per say, it involves drinking green tea with your meals, or alternatively, supplementing with green tea extract capsules. But just what is it that makes green tea so effective?

The occurrence of an anti-oxidant is one of the greatest benefits of green tea dieting. Researchers were puzzled for years as to why the French have relatively few heart diseases even though they eat a diet rich in fat. It turned out that the answer lied in red wine, which contains a chemical that reduces the negative effects of high-fat meals and smoking.

Studies later showed that the chemical found in red wine is only half as powerful as EGCG, this is another one of the huge benefits of green tea dieting. Heart disease is quite low among men In Japan, even though around 75% smoke, but because the Japanese drink green tea regularly, they can get away with it with far fewer consequences your typical Americans can, in a similar way to the French.

You may be wondering why consuming other teas in your diet do not have the same benefits of green tea dieting. This is because green tea is processed differently. While black and oolong tea leaves are oxidized through fermentation, green tea leaves are steamed, preventing the loss of anti-oxidants, which is why we have so many benefits of green tea dieting.

According to researchers one of the benefits of green tea dieting is the triggering of weight loss by helping the body burn additional calories and lowering your level of body fat. In the January 2006 issue of The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition a study was published showing those who had tea fortified with green tea extract every day for three months lost more body fat than those who drank oolong tea, proving the effectiveness of green tea in comparison to other teas.

Other research shows that another one of the biggest benefits of green tea dieting is that it helps you fight the flu by boosting your system&#8217;s immunity against viruses. Green tea has a substance in it that makes the certain cells in your body output 10 times the normal amount of interferon, which is what fights the virus. However, there are still many other benefits of green tea dieting.

There also exists solid evidence that shows that the benefits of green tea dieting includes a reduction of bladder, colon, esophageal, pancreas, rectum and stomach cancer by as much as 60%. What’s more, EGCG has been reported to be 100 times more effective than vitamin C and at least 25 times more effective than vitamin E at protecting cells. This is also one of the biggest benefits of green tea dieting.

Yet another one of the benefits of green tea dieting comes from studies in Britain which show that green tea can help slow the process of Alzheimer’s disease by inhibiting chemicals in the brain responsible for plaque and protein deposits in the gray matter of your head. It is these deposits which hinder the ability to think clearly.

Simply put, the lists of benefits of green tea dieting are too many to mention, and are supported with evidence too. Regardless of whether weight loss is a priority, I always recommend individuals drink green tea or take green tea pills regularly. Based on the many studies on the benefits of green tea dieting I recommend at least 3-5 cups a day.
