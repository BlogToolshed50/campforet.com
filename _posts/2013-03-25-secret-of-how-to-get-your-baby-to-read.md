My baby can read, so I know, for parents, nothing makes them feel prouder than knowing that their child&#8217;s skills are developing way ahead of other kids their age. Can you imagine how accomplished and proud you will feel as a parent if you have a baby who can read between the ages of three months to four years old?

Letting You In On the Secret of How to Get Your Baby to Read

Typically, a child learns to read one he or she goes to school. As a parent, is there anything that you can do from your end to get your child to develop reading skills prior to formal schooling?

When you go online, you will see a good number of products on how you can turn your baby into the next Einstein by developing the child&#8217;s academic skills at an early age. Specifically, there are products which include a set of DVDs, books and other teaching materials that will get your child reading at an early age. How are you supposed to do this, exactly, without having to purchase these usually expensive products?

Many experts agree that a child&#8217;s mind from birth up to about four years old absorbs information like a sponge. You can actually use this fact to your advantage by getting your three-month old baby to read. The following section will let you in on the secret on how you can do just that.

Top Tips on How to Get You Saying &#8220;My Baby Can Read!&#8221;

Take a look at the following tips on how you can get your baby to read:

1. When teaching your baby how to read, make sure to present the printed words in large font.
  
First, prepare the materials that you will be using to get your child to read. Chalkboards, dry erase boards, or simply a piece of paper and a marker. Once you have the materials, make sure to print each word in large font. As young as their minds are, babies will learn a lot easier and quicker if they have the visuals to go along with the words that you are teaching them to learn.

2. The first set of words which you can teach your baby to read should be familiar to them.
  
When you&#8217;re trying to get your child to learn, make sure that he or she is already familiar with the words that you will be teaching in the first place. Mommy and daddy, body parts, the things which can be seen around the playroom, animals or
  
colours are a few of the things that you can start with.

3. Use the flash cards method.
  
You should teach your baby to read in a room which has very little distraction. Then, use the flashcards method which should be visually stimulating enough to catch your child&#8217;s attention. Flash each written word in front of your child, perhaps with a bold illustration on the side, and say the word out loud. Do it one after another and each word can be taught up to three times a day. Your child would absorb the information like a sponge.

4. After getting your baby to read or learn a few words, up the ante and put the words together so that a sentence can be formed.
  
Let&#8217;s say that your child has already learned five, ten or twenty words. His or her reading will not necessarily be developed unless you start putting the words together in a sentence or an entire story.

5. Harness the power of baby reading videos.
  
There are a good number of baby reading videos which are available in the market today. Use these to combine visuals and sound so that you can effectively teach your baby how to read. The Your Baby Can Read Program does an excellent job of this.

All in all, your child&#8217;s brain processes information at incredibly high rates between the ages of three months to five years. If you want to take advantage of this fact to get your baby reading at one year old, then you should apply one of the many ways that you can get your child to read at a very young age.

My baby can read because we applied these simple principals and I am confident you can do the same if you follow a plan and stick to it.
