Approximately, 45% of the American population snores. A snoring person may not awaken the whole world, but surely enough, he can contribute to the alarming numbers of troubled couples. For this reason, snoring could be counted as one of the factors of society disorder. And if snoring alone cannot be resolved, how much more are the wrecked marriages due to partners not sharing a room?

It may sound overstated but it’s true that bed partners move out of their room because of the unwanted noise when sleeping. The consequences are not as simple as they may sound. Aside from the effects to the relationships and society, snoring can also be a symptom of a severe disease. Often, this is a sign of the sleeping disorder called “obstructive sleep apnea”. Apnea disease consumes the person by reducing the flow of oxygen to the brain, by increasing the blood pressure and worse, it can result to sudden death.

Snoring occurs because of the obstruction in the airways. When this happens, the muscles responsible for respiration had to work harder in order to deliver the oxygen to the lungs and the carbon dioxide out of the body. As people age, muscles and tissues in the body deteriorate such that they are easily strained. This defines the proportionality of the age to the severity of snoring. Tensed muscles and jaw decrease the area of the airway resulting to the annoying sound. If the area is clear, the flow of the air is easy and there would be no sleeping noise such as snoring.
