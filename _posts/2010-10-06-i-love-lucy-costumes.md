I started watching the show I Love Lucy when I was a little girl so I wasn&#8217;t really surprised when my daughter started to love the show too because I still watch it all the time when it comes on TV, which is a couple of times a day. So when I asked her what she wanted to dress up as for Halloween, she told me that she wanted to be Lucy.

I think the idea is so cute, I wish I had thought of dressing up as Lucy back when I was a little girl, that I started looking for stuff for her to wear right away. During my search for a red wig for her to wear, I saw some deals on satellite internet service and decided to click here and switch over to a new provider.

Believe it or not, most Lucy style hair wigs are for adults, not kids. So I bought an adult Lucy wig trimming it down so that it will fit on my daughter&#8217;s head. She talked one of the little neighbor boys that she pals aroudn with to dress up as Ricky so I&#8217;m going to find him a bongo set to carry around too.
