Concentration is something that can seriously decide the effectiveness of the amount of effort that you put into your work. If you are being haunted by the question about how to improve your concentration, then you are right here on &#8216;Thinking Different&#8217; for an answer. If you believed that slow steady solution are better than fast ones, then you should take my word. Constant practice is the key to remembering things. Any medicine can cause you more harm over a long run. Try shouting out the names and things you want to remember. You can also write down things that you want to remember. Over a period of time you will notice that you can still simulate the effect of shouting out or writing down even without literally doing so. This is the point when you will slowly start remembering things and will increase your concentration too.
