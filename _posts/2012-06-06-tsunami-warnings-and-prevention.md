Tsunamis cannot be prevented or precisely predicted

1.Regions with a high risk of tsunamis may use tsunami warning systems to detect tsunamis and warn the general population before the wave reaches land.
  
2.Computer models can roughly predict tsunami arrival and impact based on information about the event that triggered it and the shape of the seafloor and coastal land.
  
3.the early warnings comes from nearby animals.
  
4.building tsunami walls of up to 4.5 m (13.5 ft) high in front of populated coastal areas.
  
5.floodgates and channels to redirect the water from incoming tsunamis.
  
6.Environmentalists have suggested tree planting along stretches of sea coast which are prone to tsunami risks, it would take some years for the trees to grow to a useful size. And such plantations could offer a much cheaper and longer-lasting means of tsunami mitigation.
