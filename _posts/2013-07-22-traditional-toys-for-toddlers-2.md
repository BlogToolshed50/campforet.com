Toddlers are learning to walk, learning to run, and exploring their world in full force with all five senses. Toys that stimulate their curiosity and aid in their development are the best choices at this age. Toddlers have graduated from their baby toys, needing traditional toys that encourage more manipulation with fingers and hands and toys that develop large muscles, but they have not yet developed all the skills needed to play with preschool traditional toys. There are a wide selection of toys available that are designed just for the toddler age and offer lots of opportunities for development and learning.

Push and pull toys are often favorites of toddlers. Push toys allow toddlers to practice walking and are great for balancing during the first steps, while pull toys are best for those who are already walking to gain more of a mastery of balance and coordination. Push and pull toys that create sounds or lights with movement are especially delightful to toddlers.

Blocks and stacking toys are also appropriate toddler traditional toys. Look for blocks that are too large to fit inside a childâ€™s mouth with simple, easy to manipulate shapes. Stacking toys that encourage size discrimination are excellent for enhancing cognitive development and logical thinking.

Foot powered ride on toys are enjoyed by most toddlers. These scooter styled ride ons develop large muscles used to walk, run, and jump, and are available in many designs to spur imaginative play and creativity. Many ride on toys are available in convertible models that include a detachable handle for an adult pushed ride until the toddler is ready to power herself.

Simple puzzles and activity toys are ideal choices for educational traditional toys. Wooden puzzles with one large piece or no more than five big pieces are easy for toddlers to manipulate. Toys with buttons and knobs that cause noises, lights, or things to pop up are perfect for developing problem solving skills, as well as fine motor.

Books are good, quality traditional toys at any age. Toddlers will do best with thick, chunky board books. These books are designed for young children that may rip pages or chew corners. Board books typically have lots of colorful pictures that attract the attention of toddlers. They are great to read aloud at story time or for toddlers to explore on their own.

Soft dolls without loose hair and stuffed animals are toys that many toddlers cherish into their preschool years. Look for stuffed toys that feature painted or sewn facial features to avoid choking hazards. Encourage your toddler to engage in pretend play by providing baby blankets and toy doll furniture as props for playtime.

Toddlers are developing large muscle skills at a very rapid rate. Encourage this development with soft, squishy balls to roll, bounce, toss, and kick. Beanbags are also great toys to develop arm muscles as well as hand and eye coordination.

The best traditional toys for toddlers are those that are simple to use, yet invites the child to think and explore various outcomes. Toddler toys should stimulate their natural curiosity and lead them to discover new skills. Traditional toys that exercise large motor skills are also ideal for toddlers.
