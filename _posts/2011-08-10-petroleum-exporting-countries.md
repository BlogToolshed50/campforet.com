OPEC is the organization representing oil producing countries. They form a consortium and decide the production level. This ultimately regulate the demand and supply. Though these nations in the group are not having all the oil producing countries in their group still majority are the members in it. They periodically discuss and make a decision to the supply level. Price of the oil is also influenced by their collective decision based on the supply and production. Recently based on the request made by the US government Saudi Arabia who is member in this consortium agreed to produce 200,000 barrels of crude in excess of what they are now producing. Thus, OPEC can alter the supply position leading to the control on the price.
