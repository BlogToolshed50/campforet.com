There are just too many ways which you can screw up your word-press installation. A small change in the domain name can also create weird changes. For someone who is not used to word-press structures it is a moment of panic. But the best part about word-press is that at any stage you can really save all the posts and data even if the whole website crashes. Thus, if you are a novice who is really not sure about what you have done and have got your word-press installation or the blog down, don&#8217;t worry much. Just get your friend who has spent enough time on word-press and you can be sure of having your blog back on track.
