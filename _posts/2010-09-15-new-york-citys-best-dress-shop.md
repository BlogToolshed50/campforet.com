I love the show “Say Yes to the Dress” because it is a show about women who are buying wedding gowns. I started watching it to get an idea of what type of gown I wanted when my husband and I renewed our wedding vows, but now I watch it because the gowns are so beautiful and the staff is so bubbly. I still have not chosen a gown, but I plan to keep watching “Say Yes to the Dress” on my Kansas direct tv.

I would love to go to New York and be able to shop with Randy, the fashion manager. He is so insightful and funny at the same time. Not only can he hone in on exactly what a bride wants for her gown, but he can diffuse almost any stalemate between the bride and her family. He has a great knack of being able to dress up the bride in her favorite gown, with all the trappings that her family would like. This helps the mother of the bride be able to support her daughter&#8217;s choice of gowns, even if she did not like it in the first place.

This is a great show and I watch it every day. I wish I had Randy as my fashion coach when I was picking out my wedding gown. He makes shopping easy.
