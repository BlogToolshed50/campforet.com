Early Adopters Are Big Buyers

If you have a particular market niche where new products come out all the time, you will want to cultivate the early adopters to make faster sales. Technical market niches tend to rely on early adopters to help drive sales, and once the word is out, if the product is good it will fly off the shelves. So, how do you go about cultivating early adopters?

Identify The Big Promoters

It isn&#8217;t just enough to have a contact list with people who love technical gadgets or cookies. You have to identify people who can quickly promote your products, if they like them. One way to do that is to find blog owners who are within your market niche who have a big following. Ask them if they would like to review your product, either for pay or for the product itself. If it&#8217;s something of interest to them and their readers, you won&#8217;t have much trouble twisting their arms to get them to comply, especially if you find ways to sweeten the pot. The goal here is to get your product reviewed by an expert in the market niche and promote it by getting the word out as soon as possible to as many people in that niche as possible. Getting people who already have cultivated that audience and are willing to share it with you is a clever way to reach many multiple early adopters.
