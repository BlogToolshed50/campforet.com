In fact, the ISS is said to be by far the largest artificial satellite, which serves as the research laboratory.

ISS has a microgravity environment where in the crews are able to conduct experiments in on various subjects like biology, physics astronomy human biology and a lot on meteorology. It is a matter of pride for the human kind that the programmer in ISS is approaching the record 10 years of operation by 23rd Oct2010.
