The article written by Landon Gilbert

I know it might not seem like the most obvious &#8220;best movie for a date night&#8221;, but for me and the boyfriend, it is all about LA Confidential. On our very first date, we decided to ditch going to a high paying restaurant and go back to my apartment and watch some of the best hd tv service. I made some spaghetti while he put got to choose a movie.

Suffice to say, we ended up watching this great neo-noir crime drama starring Russel Crow and Guy Pearce. It is a pretty gritty affair with lots of shooting and punching. Of course, it isn&#8217;t entirely without heart: Crow falls for a classic &#8220;hooker with a heart of gold&#8221; played by Kim Bassinger, who earned an Academy Award for her work. No one

In the midst of all the crime solving and political intrigue, the two of us shared our very first kiss. Two years later, we&#8217;re still together and when we want to sit down and remember good times, we&#8217;ll still watch LA Confidential. Unlike Crowe and Bassinger, we didn&#8217;t need a murder investigation to make it work.
