This guest post from Edgardo Rosa

It has been over a decade since the Denver Broncos wont back to back Super Bowls. Since John Elway left it has not been the same in the Mile High city. Sure we had Jake Plummer and Jay Cutler, but no one with the winning ways of Elway has graced the city. We always get off to these hot starts and then fade away down the stretch.

Denver has to get back to running the football and playing good defense. Easier said than done, but the defense has not been good, except for the first 6 games last year. Maybe with Tim Tebow competing for the starting job there will be some excitement in the air. I am not saying he is the greatest thing in the world, but maybe he could give a little boost for 5 &#8211; 10 plays per game.

I moved from the city 4 years ago so I have to watch the games on John Elway and those Super Bowl champions.
