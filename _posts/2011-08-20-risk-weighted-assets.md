Risk weighted assets are those that are assigned with a share of the capital in the banking industry. The proportion at which the capital assigned to different type of assets depend upon the extent of risk perceived to be associated with such asset. There are certain international standards which prescribes the percentage of capital that is to be assigned to each item. Providing less than that will put they said banks under the scanner of the international monitoring agencies in the banking sector.
