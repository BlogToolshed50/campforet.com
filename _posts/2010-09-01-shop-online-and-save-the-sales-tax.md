Guest post of the week by Brittany Booker

I love shopping online with hughes net satellite internet because it is often so much cheaper than shopping in a store. Besides the benefit of being able to shop from home and not actually having to go to a store, shopping online is a great way to save money. One of the reasons that this is so cheap is that online-only retailers, like Amazon, don&#8217;t have to collect sales tax, which makes items quite a bit cheaper. This has to do with laws that only require a company to collect sales tax from residents in states where that company has a physical presence. Often times, on large enough purchases, I find that it is so much cheaper to buy items online that that makes up for the shipping charge, and still results in it being cheaper from online.

Buying from online with my hughesnet internet packages is a great way to save money. Also, one advantage that large online retailers have is that they don&#8217;t have to run stores, and so that saves them money, and allows them to make products cheaper. I really enjoy shopping online because of the money it saves me.
