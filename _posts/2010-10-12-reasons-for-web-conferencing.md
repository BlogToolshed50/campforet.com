Web conferencing is still a young technology. Initial effort with web conferencing just started late 1990s and is still in the process of improvement and development. Although the technology is still young, businesses and companies are seeing the potential in web conferencing. 

Companies are seeing web conferencing as a way to cut down expenses for their employees travel. Instead of sending employees to other locations, employees are now hosting web conferences with clients or with colleagues for collaborations. Also employees get to avoid travel stress as an effect of travel delays, traffic congestion and other travel issues.

A developer of web-based learning systems used web conferencing to reduce the cost of pre-qualifying sales leads. Normally, it would take them two days and $800 to fly a salesperson to the West Coast for a one-hour meeting that could still result to a no-sale. With web conferencing, they were able to meet with the client and provide presentations about the product without spending money and time as they did before. 

Employees are opting for web conferencing since they are able to get the necessary data they would need for presentations or discussions. Necessary data and demonstrations are just a click away. This effective way of rolling out products will definitely interest clients. Clients immediately understand the product after presentations or demonstrations. Such effective communication and demonstration may encourage the client to purchase or subscribe to the product being offered.

Web conferencing also forges a global connection. Employees get to connect and interact with colleagues located in other branches or offices in different locations. Collaboration and cooperation are forged over web conferencing especially for online projects between local and international colleagues. This build stronger employee relationship geared toward productivity.
