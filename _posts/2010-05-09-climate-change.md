Climate Change is the greatest threaten the globe is facing in the light of the excess carbon emission. Countries like the USA emits six times more CO2 into the atmosphere when compared to the developing nations. The impact of such climatic change is already observed in the forms of unprecedented melting of the glaciers and the sudden down pour in various parts of the world. Flood and drought are the resultant phenomenon due to the climatically change. Developed countries like the USA and Europe need to think in terms of reducing their energy consumption thereby helping the other nations to have less impact on account of climatically change. Developing countries too should go a slow in energy consumption to avoid pollution.
