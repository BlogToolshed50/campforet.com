If I say the words &#8220;mind control&#8221;, what pops into your head?
  
Science fiction ray-guns, maybe, or a sinister-looking hypnotist murmuring &#8220;You are in my power&#8221;..?

Well, let&#8217;s kick those myths and stereotypes straight out! No device has yet been invented allowing you to control other people&#8217;s minds and make them do anything you want.

Neither can a hypnotist force you to do anything against your will. All a hypnotist does is guide you into a hypnotic state. The hypnotist may make suggestions, but you always have the power to reject these if they conflict with your moral code.

But there ARE mind control techniques you can use on yourself (and others) to help achieve desired goals, e.g. boosting self-confidence or overcoming inhibitions. These methods work by by-passing the conscious mind and communicating directly with the subconscious.

What is the subconscious?
  
It&#8217;s the part of our brain that controls our deepest-seated habits and behavior. The subconscious absorbs any messages that reach it and uses them to build new thought-patterns and behaviors. If you want to achieve real, deep-seated change, it MUST take place at a subconscious level.

One of the best ways of accessing the subconscious directly is subliminal messaging. Subliminal messages are transmitted below an individual&#8217;s normal threshold of perception. For example, a visual message might be shown very briefly and not seen by a person consciously, yet perceived by them at an subconscious level.

You might ask what&#8217;s the value of sending a message if the person isn&#8217;t aware of receiving it&#8230;
  
And yet, that&#8217;s EXACTLY what makes subliminal messaging so powerful. Our critically-aware conscious mind normally filters out most of the many messages we receive every day, so they have no influence on us. Subliminal messages by-pass the conscious mind and go straight to the subconscious, where they can have a real and lasting impact.

To use subliminal for self-development, of course, you need a method for administering the messages so you aren&#8217;t consciously aware of them. There are several possibilities, but in this article I&#8217;d like to spotlight the Subliminal Power software.

Subliminal Power comes loaded with hundreds of subliminal messaging scripts. You simply select the ones you want &#8211; e.g. improve your memory &#8211; and the program flashes up messages on your PC screen. These are too brief to see consciously, so they go straight to your subconscious, where they immediately start to &#8220;re-program&#8221; your mind with the thought-patterns you desire.

But maybe you&#8217;d prefer your subliminal delivered through your ears rather than your eyes? Then subliminal CDs could be the answer&#8230;

This method has the advantage that you don&#8217;t have to be looking at your computer screen, or even be near a computer at all. Most subliminal CDs can be played on any audio device.

As with visual methods, subliminal CDs work by sending positive affirmations directly to the subconscious. There are many ways to achieve this. The most common is the &#8220;background whisper&#8221;, where the conscious mind only hears part of the message, but the subconscious compensates and pieces together the whole message, accepting it as a &#8220;mental command.&#8221; Other powerful techniques include stereo confusion, reverse messages, and silent sound.

It&#8217;s important to note, though, that not all subliminal CDs are the same.
  
In particular, many CDs sold commercially use just ONE of the methods mentioned above.

We&#8217;re all different, however, and a method that works well for one person may be barely effective with another. It must make sense, therefore, to combine all the most effective methods on one CD. And that&#8217;s just what Subliminal-CDs.com have down with their award-winning range of subliminal CD recordings.
  
The site is officially the Web&#8217;s largest subliminal CD and MP3 store, and it offers over 120 powerful subliminal recordings, all professionally produced using the unique 5-part Encoding System™ developed by Bradley Thompson.
  
Whatever your goal, from beating depression to increasing your confidence with the opposite sex, at Subliminal CDs you are certain to find a product that will help you achieve this.
  
But maybe you want to take things one step further and create your own tailor-made CDs &#8211; for your own use, or to give (or sell) to others.

With Subliminal-Studio you can create your own subliminal CDs, using exactly the same mechanisms as in the company&#8217;s Subliminal-CDs.com recordings.

To guide you, you get a book by self-development guru Bradley Thompson, &#8220;Developing your own Subliminal-Studio&#8221;. This takes you through the process of creating your own subliminal recordings, step-by-step.

In addition, you&#8217;ll also receive Subliminal-Studio software CD. This contains all the tools and resources you need to create your own subliminal CDs in literally minutes.

It includes royalty-free background music, 2 hours of bin-aural beats, 2½ hours of sounds from nature, 22 professionally recorded subliminal scripts in MP3 format, and a sought-after script for creating your own silent subliminal (a VERY powerful technique). You also get a trial version of Adobe Audition for compiling your recordings.

A royalty-free license is provided with all the audio resources. That means you can retail your own commercial recordings at no extra cost. You could sell the CDs you produce with this package at craft fairs, for example, or through an eBay shop.

Make no mistake: The mind control techniques revealed here may sound simple, but they are EXTREMELY powerful.
  
By following my advice, and with a little help from these excellent tools, you really can take control of your mind and re-program it to achieve almost anything you desire. Not only that, if you wish you can produce your own mind control products that will help others do likewise.

Good luck, and enjoy the amazing mind control power.
