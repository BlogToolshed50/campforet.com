Warm summer days filled with bright sunshine aren&#8217;t always good for you. Over exposure to sunlight can cause serious sunburn, pain and the long-term risk of skin cancer. St. John Ambulance, Canada&#8217;s leader in safety-orientedâ„¢ first aid training and products, points out that you can still enjoy sun if you reduce risk by taking precautions.

People with fair skin are most susceptible to sunburns. However, no matter what the skin type, the harmful effects of the sun, such as sunburn, can be sustained by anyone.

Prevention is your best defense. Use a sunscreen strong enough to block out harmful rays. Remember to apply it liberally many times over the course of a day in the sun as it will soak into skin, evaporate and be washed off in water.

Don&#8217;t stay outdoors for extended periods without covering exposed skin. Never leave tender skin exposed for more than a few minutes at a time. Wear a light, sun repellent cover over bathing suits or other light clothing. Always keep your head and eyes protected.

First Aid for sunburn

Sunburns can be very serious. Ranging from mild discomfort to severe burning over a large portion of the body, extreme sunburn can be further complicated by heatstroke. For minor sunburn, St. John Ambulance suggests the following first aid:

1. Check the casualty thoroughly to determine the extent and severity of the burn.
     
2. Get out of the sun immediately.
     
3. Cover the burn with a wet towel or gently sponge the area with cool water to relieve pain.
     
4. Pat the skin dry and apply medicated sunburn ointment or lotion. Apply according to directions on the package and watch for warning signs of an allergic reaction.
     
5. Protect burnt areas from further exposure to the sun.
     
6. Don&#8217;t break blisters &#8211; doing so may promote infection. If large areas of the skin begin to blister, seek medical help.
     
7. If the casualty begins to vomit or develops a fever, give first aid for heatstroke and get medical help.
