To deal with structured cabling contractor is quite a challenging one. I realized this while finishing up the wiring work in my new multi-unit office. Being a company, we had to get our network cables perfectly placed across all our racks. The slightest mistake in doing so would affect us our business a lot. Our servers had down that times our customers really displeasure and hence we were seeking the best electrical contractor who has experts in this field.

Apart form the internet cable layout, it was really important to get the telephone, fax and other electrical wiring in place. There are many service providers who claim to undertake these large cable installations, but we need cabling contractor who offer quality service. Especially in cable installation tasks, lot depends on the quality of the product itself in addition to the skill sets of the data cabling installers.

In our case we had a vendor who failed in both aspects. The good news was that, when I came across mason247.com that is a data cabling installation company and offer a variety of cable contracting services serving large scale offices and buildings. They are experienced in their business and I believe that they are the best service provider of telecommunication solutions.
