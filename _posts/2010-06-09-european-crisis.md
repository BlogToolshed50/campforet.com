When the financial management is not adhered to properly, we have to face many more European crisis. For an ordinary citizen, the impact of such crisis is something enormous. The international impact is also a matter of concern. Many countries who are dependent on the European countries for their trade get affected easily due to the slumping market. The share markets worldwide too got affected. As a layman one could easily assign various reasons for such debacle.

The failure on the part of the policy makers and the regulator can be the first and foremost reason for the present status of the affair. The recent crisis in Greece was averted to some extent owing to the infusion of about $ one trillion jointly by IMF and the European Union. In fact, the financial crisis has confirmed that the so-called economic prosperity in the euro zone was not a reality, but an illusion. The ultimate results is the weakening of the euro impacting the strength of other currencies too. Out of the 16 members of the European Union countries like Germany, France and the Netherlands re found to be having reasonable financial health while the remaining are not out of the wood.

It is a matter of grave concern that countries such as Spain and Portugal, faced with predicaments similar to the one in Greece, are still at risk of sovereign debt default. To bail out them the present infusion made. But the concern is that, how far such nursing can go ahead if most of the nations face such situation. It is better that each country formulate their own policies and regulations to ensure healthy banking system that is the fundamental need for the prosperity of any country. Such systems in place will certain to avert such disasters in the future and the common man will not suffer any more.
