It is hard to believe that it is time to go shopping for back to school supplies. Every year I try to find the places that offer discounts and coupons to help purchase the supplies that are needed. This year we have decided to do our shopping the Friday before school starts. Saturdays are way too busy. We will leave early Friday morning to go have door alarm before going shopping. Times are rough and it seems that houses are broken into during this time of year.

We will be shopping for shorts, shirts, underwear, socks and shoes. My 5 year old will need a mat for nap time at school. The school has given us a list for hand sanitizer, paper towels, lotion, anti-bacterial soap, crayons, scissors, glue, pencils, and kleenex tissues. This is for the entire class to use through out the year. I will shop at Walgreen&#8217;s also because they have great deals on these types of items. My 9 year old will need a graphing calculator this year. I will also buy book bags, note book paper, note books, and ink pens. This will get the school year started.
