Thanks for the guest post by Jonathan Curtis

My family loves the fall season, mainly because every year we have a big weenie roast at my parents&#8217; house. All the kids dress up in their costumes and we sit around the fire talking and laughing. Sometimes my parents even have a live band, which is always fun. There are lots of caramel apples and cupcakes and other sweet treats. And, of course, the kids love making s&#8217;mores.

My mom decorates the background with lighted pumpkins and scarecrows, and my dad turns his pickup truck and trailer into a haunted online offer ADT Indianapolis) before we went to grandma and grandpa&#8217;s house and they usually fall to sleep within a few minutes.

The weenie roast is, without a doubt, my favorite family gathering of the year, including Christmas. I think because it reminds me of simple pleasures and my own childhood.
