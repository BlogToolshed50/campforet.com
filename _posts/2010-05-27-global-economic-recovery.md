Nowadays many economists come out with their own prediction on the economic growth when the global turmoil on the economic front is haunting the globe. For the year 2011 it is expected that the global growth will be in the order of 3.8 percent. Also, the purchasing parity is estimated to strike a level of not less than 4.1 percent compared to 3.60 percent arrived at during January 2010.

The major uncertainty that is expected to make and mar the estimate of economic growth is said to be the European crisis. The Euro zone crisis is sure to affect the leading economies like China as they are not decoupled with the crisis in Europe. Though the economists predict a better level of growth, the momentum is expected to be little slow in 2010

As I read through various articles, the situation is not so encouraging unless the nations take appropriate steps to revamp their strategies to tackle the issue. Overheated economy like China must think about increasing the interest rate and ensuring the flexibility in the value of the Yuan to assist the global recovery. The policy makers of various nations must arrive at a consensus to ensure healthy economic growth without affecting the other nations for sustained global recovery.
