Using closed end funds for growth and income

If you’re looking for more income, this article could shed some light on the advantages of deeply discounted closed end funds and demonstrated advantages over no-load mutual funds, exchange traded funds (EFT), and loaded mutual funds for income investors. In my over 20 years of investing I’ve constantly seen people make the same mistake of paying too much for their investment. This article is designed to educate on a very unique investment style designed to achieve a greater probability for growth, higher current income, and lower overall risk.
  
First some basic facts about closed end funds

According to Lee, Shleifer and Thaler (1990) from 1980-1998 the average discount on most US closed end fund varied from 0-20% and averaged around 5%.

According to the Investment Company Institute, at the end of 2005 there were 634 closed-end funds with combined assets of about $276.35 billion.
  
Many of the same managers of open end funds have loaded and no-load funds along with closed end funds and often have similar investments, risk, and returns.

Closed end funds are:
  
1. Issued at net asset value (NAV) or above
  
2. On average they trade at a relative discount
  
3. The discount or premium is subject to wide variations over time and across all funds and classes.
  
4. At termination, the price converges back to NAV

How to increase your income

It’s currently trades at a 15.71 % discount and has a 6.64% income from dividends. What this means is that for every $85 dollars invested you will have $100 that’s working for you. At the end of every day the markets calculates the value of the portfolios. For instance, your portfolio is worth 100,000 dollars you could sell it to your spouse or someone else for $85,000 that is what a 15% discount means. Now if that $100,000 portfolio was paying 5.65% or $5,650 dollars per year in income as dividends, then a person now bought it at $85,000 will still receive that same dollar amount or $5,650 income. But since the income from the portfolio is the same and the cost is about $15,000 dollars lower than the new current income is 6.64%. We would like to take you through three simple examples, since the investing family has closed loaded and no load funds. I would make the same assumption on the next three examples that the manager had the same stocks in each structure.

Risks

The only two addition risks that we could identify was that closed end funds have:
  
1. Higher volatility- meaning the price could go up and down more than traditional mutual funds.
  
2.* Even if purchased at a large discount the discount could become even greater over time.

To Reduce Risk

With an effort to reduce the risks associated with closed ended funds at deep discounts with high income we recommend diversification using many different asset classes and fund families utilizing asset allocation approach. In our growth and income model we use 7 different asset classes to provide a balanced portfolio. This structure was designed to minimize fluctuations. For example, an event that might hurt one class of investments might benefit another. An example of this is after the 9/11 terrorist attack and the 2000 stock market crash. In both cases the stock market had a tremendous sell off, but the high grade bonds had very large rallies. During those two events the stock market and high grade bonds were not correlated. Many experts believe diversifying between asset classes is the single best way to reduce volatility risk

When building portfolio’s we use a selection criteria that focus on: unique asset classes, deep discount , high yield, consistency of payments, ongoing fee’s and other factors we incorporate into the selection are, past track record of the fund, and past track record of the management team, and of course the management team. We apply our selection criteria to over 600 closed ended funds with a goal to find only 1 or 2 in each asset class that fits our needs.

Simply don’t put all your eggs in one basket. If the assets classes are non-correlated then this reduces the portfolio risk.

How to Increase your Principle

Now performance here is what the USA Today said about discounted closed end funds “If you&#8217;re patient, buying funds at a steep discount can be extremely lucrative? For example, suppose you divided the closed-end universe into fifths, starting with the most expensive. The priciest 20 percent gained 48 percent in the past five years. The 20 percent with the steepest discounts, however, soared 160 percent.”

According to USA today the returns for largest discounted closed end fund beat the premium funds by 300%

Common Sense

It just makes good common sense. The less you pay for an investment the higher the probability of getting a better return. Finding an investment at a 10-20% discount for similar portfolio’s that others are paying a premium is very basic to investing. The next time someone is selling you a ETF or a mutual fund with a 5% load just for income just remember this paper because you might be able to find a similar portfolio from the same managers in a closed end fund with 10-20% cheaper plus receive about a 10-20% higher current income.
  
If you invest in a deep discount closed end fund with high income you receive more invested principle for less money.
