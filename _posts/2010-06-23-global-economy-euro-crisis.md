When every one of us felt relieved after the global economic crisis that destabilized the world economy soon after the collapse of Lehman brothers, the present European crisis started hitting badly. The main reason attributed by the economists is the interconnected government debt owned within Europe. European economy is found to be very slow now and is bound to hit the global demand.

To begin with the European economy is bound to get affected if not the needed stimulus is infused. As I read elsewhere, this may have adverse impact on the Asian economy also if proper curative measures are not taken. The overheated Chinese economy is also creating concern among the economists worldwide which may result in an asset bubble. Tightening policy by the Chinese is feared to be a major factor driving the stock market worldwide towards negative territory.

One more country which I feel may affect the global economy is the present status of Japan. The prediction is that, Japan will be impacted by the concerns about China growth slowing and is likely to have a government debt crisis as the government debt in Japan is 12% of GDP. As many leading economists predict, the crisis that has hit Europe may unfold to move to Japan and then it will finally hit the US. But the solace remains in the fact that each nation is feeling the pinch and is aggressively trying to avert such global disaster.
