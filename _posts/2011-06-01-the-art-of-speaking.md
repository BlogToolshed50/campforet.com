The art of speaking makes a person highly successful and become adored by others. Most of our social contacts are attained through the process of speech. In order to have training in etiquette, one should have the knowledge to speak in a correct manner. The most important part of speech, whether private or public, is the form of address. If the first address is soothing and impressive, much of the purpose may have been served. Generally, if a person has the right approach or method of address, it is almost certain that he will gain his objective.

Speaking is the main ingredient of good manners and the art of speaking softly and gently to produce a feeling of maximum civility is to be acquired like any other art. There are people who may speak as if they own the world and the very approach to people on any subject is sure to provoke resentment in the latter. One should have the requisite training to develop the art of speaking to become successful in the life.
