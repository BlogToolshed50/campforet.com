The grand object for which a gentleman exists, is to excel in company. Conversation is the mean of his distinction, the drawing-room the scene of his glory. 

In company, though none are &#8220;free,&#8221; yet all are &#8220;equal.&#8221; All therefore whom you meet, should be treated with equal respect, although interest may dictate toward each different degrees of attention. It is disrespectful to the invitee to shun any of her guests. Those whom she has honored by asking to her house, you should sanction by admitting to your acquaintance. 

If you meet any one whom you have never heard of before, you may converse with him with entire propriety. The form of &#8220;introduction&#8221; is nothing more than a statement by a mutual friend that two gentlemen are by rank and manners fit acquaintances for one another. All this may be presumed from the fact, that both meet at a respectable house. This is the theory of the matter. Custom, however, requires that you should take the earliest opportunity afterwords to be regularly presented to such an one. 

The great business in company is conversation. It should be studied as art. Style in conversation is as important, and as capable of cultivation as style in writing. The manner of saying things is what gives them their value. 

The most important requisite for succeeding here, is constant and unfaltering attention. That which Churchill has noted as the greatest virtue on the stage, is also the most necessary in company, to be &#8220;always attentive to the business of the scene.&#8221; Your understanding should, like your person, be armed at all points. Never go into society with your mind en dishabille. It is fatal to success to be all absent or distrait. 

The secret of conversation has been said to consist in building upon the remark of your companion. Men of the strongest minds, who have solitary habits and bookish dispositions, rarely excel in sprightly colloquy, because they seize upon the thing itself, the subject abstractly, instead of attending to the language of other speakers, and do not cultivate verbal pleasantries and refinements. He who does otherwise gains a reputation for quickness, and pleases by showing that he has regarded the observation of others.
