Many people are their own worst enemy when it comes to writing a good resume. It does not matter if they have a wonderful background, impeccable credentials or fabulous experience if their resume contains misused words, the wrong word tense or is not easily readable. Following is a series of resume writing tips from things I have seen on some people&#8217;s resumes that drive me &#8220;crazy:&#8221;

TIP 1: Do not be too focused on tasks and duties performed at work. Give yourself credit for accomplishment by including some achievements. Include such things as:

• Examples of how you performed the job better than others
  
• Some of the problems or challenges you faced and ways that you overcame them
  
• Results, results, and results
  
• Ways that the organization benefited from your performance
  
• Reference to awards, special recognition or promotions you received

TIP 2: An objective statement that is too wordy or non-specific. Over the years of working at with a resume service company, I&#8217;ve spoken with many CEO&#8217;s who have told me about candidates who lose their readers at the opening line. Statements like &#8220;A challenging position that enables me to contribute to organizational goals while offering an opportunity for growth and advancement&#8221; are cliché&#8217;, too generalized, and waste space. If you are on a career track, replace the objective with a statement stating what you do or something of your expertise.

Tip 3: Professional resumes should be concise and written in a telegraphic style without using &#8220;I&#8221; or &#8220;me.&#8221; Example: &#8220;Developed new products that added $5 million in sales and increased the company&#8217;s gross margin by 15 percent.&#8221; This style gets to the point quickly and communicates clearly.

Tip 4: Is it &#8220;percent&#8221; or &#8220;percentage?&#8221; Use the word &#8220;percent&#8221; with numbers, and use &#8220;percentage&#8221; without using a number. Examples: &#8220;Over 20 percent of our gross profit came from previous sales.&#8221; &#8220;A large percentage of Native Americans live in Alaska.&#8221;

Tip 5: Be careful in choosing the right word. Example: Some people write the word &#8220;balance&#8221; when they mean &#8220;remainder.&#8221; &#8220;Balance&#8221; means &#8220;a degree of equality,&#8221; e.g., &#8220;wanting to balance the checkbook.&#8221; &#8220;Remainder,&#8221; or &#8220;what is leftover,&#8221; is used in all other situations, e.g., &#8220;put the remainder of my food in the dog&#8217;s bowl.&#8221;

Tip 6: The expression &#8220;a couple of&#8221; is usually plural in meaning. Example: &#8220;A couple of customers have reported a shortage in their orders.&#8221; However, when using the phrases &#8220;a couple of days&#8221; and &#8220;a couple of dollars,&#8221; the verb used should be singular. When the phrase &#8220;a couple of&#8221; is used in conjunction with a period of time, amount of money, or quantity that represents a total amount, treat the expression as singular. Example: &#8220;All I need is a couple of days to complete this report.&#8221;

Do not let such easily correctable items stand between you and your next career assignment. If word tense, grammar or the turn of a phrase is not your forte&#8217;, consider hiring a professional resume writer. Such people write resumes for a living and the good ones guarantee their work. Landing the job makes such a move well worth it.
