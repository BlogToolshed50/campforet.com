Electric cars are slowly picking up in various countries. Battery operated vehicles are coming to the markets and many cars producers are diverting towards this sun rise sector. This has been compelled by the rising fuel cost coupled with the atmospheric pollution due to the use of petroleum driven cars. Small cars with reasonable speed are invented to begin with to suit the road condition and other infrastructures to recharge the energy. Once this sector grows it is going to be very big boom for the human kind as it reduces the cost of maintenance apart from helping the world to minimize the global warming.
