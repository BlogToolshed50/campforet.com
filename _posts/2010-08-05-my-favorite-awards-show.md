My favorite awards show would have to be the Oscars. Every year I make it a point to watch this particular awards show. I get so excited as the date nears. I always make sure that I&#8217;m not disturbed while I am watching them by turning off my phone. I&#8217;m always so excited as I check my directv channel lineup around San Diego and watch the pre-show before the main show begins.

I&#8217;m not exactly sure which part is my most favorite, but I would probably have to say that the dresses the Actresses wear are probably one of my most favorite things. Each year I play a game with myself and try to figure out which ones will be on the best and worst dress lists the following day. I&#8217;m the type that goes for classic beauty. I don&#8217;t like when they dress really &#8220;out there&#8221;. I love the long flowing gowns or the ones that resemble old fashion designs.

I&#8217;m also a big fan of the hair. I love to see how each actress is going to wear their hair. I like when they wear it down and curly. I&#8217;m not really crazy about up-do&#8217;s. Some actresses really know how to put their elegant looks together. It&#8217;s so important not to over do the look. Some actresses wear loud dresses and loud hairstyles. You can&#8217;t have both.
