A man rushed into a veterinarian&#8217;s office carrying his limp, lifeless dog. The vet examined the animal and told the man the dog was dead. The man asked if there was any way the doctor could revive the dog. The doctor left the room and returned with a cat, who sniffed the dog from head to tail then looked up at the vet and meowed.

&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing I can do.&#8221;
  
&#8220;Thanks for trying,&#8221; said the man with a sigh. &#8220;How much do I owe you?&#8221;
  
&#8220;Three hundred and fifty dollars,&#8221; replied the doctor.
  
&#8220;Three hundred and fifty dollars! Just to tell me my dog is dead?&#8221;
  
&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the doctor, &#8220;it was $50 for the office visit. The other $300 is for the CAT scan.&#8221;

Whether the above joke made you laugh or groan, it lightened your mood. And if you had been in pain, many scientists agree, it would have eased the hurt—at least temporarily.

A fresh take on an old idea

The notion that laughter is good for the body has been around for thousands of years—certainly as far back as the Old Testament. Proverbs 17:22 says, &#8220;A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.&#8221;

Seventeenth century English physician Dr. Thomas Sydenham remarked, &#8220;The arrival of a good clown exercises more beneficial influence upon the health of a town than of twenty asses laden with drugs.&#8221; Or as Groucho Marx put it, &#8220;A clown is like aspirin, only he works twice as fast.&#8221;

How do you get a sweet 80-year-old lady to say the F word? Get another sweet little 80-year-old lady to yell \*BINGO\*!

The value of laughter in helping to relieve pain began to attract significant attention in the 1980s when Dr. Norman Cousins in his book Anatomy of an Illness described how watching Marx Brother movies and reading humorous books and articles helped him recover from a life-threatening tissue disease.

Cousins made it a point to enjoy a hearty belly laugh several times a day. He claimed that a few minutes of laughter gave him an hour or more of pain-free sleep. As a result, many pain centers around the country began to use humor therapy to reduce the level of pain medication needed by patients.

There was even a movie made about real-life doctor Patch Adams, a physician who was totally committed to making his patients laugh as an essential part of his treatment.
