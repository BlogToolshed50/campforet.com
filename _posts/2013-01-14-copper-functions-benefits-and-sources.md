Although only small amounts of the mineral copper are needed to stay healthy, copper still has an important role in many of the bodyâ€™s functions. Even a small copper deficiency can begin to cause health problems. When you take in the right amount of copper every day, your health will improve in a variety of ways.

Copper plays a vital role in bone health. Studies have shown that those who take in a good amount of copper experience less bone density loss, which decreases the occurrence of osteoporosis. Copper can also help regulate the levels of good and bad cholesterol in the body, which means it can improve and maintain the health of your heart. Copper is a component of melanin, which pigments the skin, hair, and eyes. Because of this, proper levels of copper can prevent and even reverse many discoloration problems in these areas. Copper also influences the production of collagen and helps keep the skin looking supple. Copper also has anti-inflammatory properties, which is extremely beneficial to those with arthritis and joint pain. Copper also aids in the absorption of iron, which helps to balance hemoglobin levels.

It is important to remember that copper is only required in very small amounts. Those who consume moderate amounts of seafood, beans, and leafy greens, and those who drink water that flows through copper pipes or those who use copper cookware probably do not require a copper supplement. Because the mineral zinc can inhibit copper absorption, most supplements containing zinc also contain a small dose of copper. In high doses, copper can actually be very toxic. For these reasons, most people do not need to take a copper supplement in addition to their daily diets and supplements. However, those who are working to improve the conditions of their heart, bone, or joint health will want to talk to their doctor to see if a copper supplement might be right for them.
