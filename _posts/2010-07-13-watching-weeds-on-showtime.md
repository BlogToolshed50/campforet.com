My favorite show on a premium channel is Weeds on Showtime. This show has suspense, drama, action, romance, and comedy, making it the perfect viewing experience. The characters in the show are fun and exciting, and the same goes with the story line.

This show is about a mother of two kids who has suddenly become a widow. Her husband had always provided everything that she and the children needed, so she is not sure how to survive. Instead of going out and getting a real job to pay the bills, she begins to sell weed. She soon has a thriving business going with the help of her pot smoking friends. It isn&#8217;t all smooth sailing though, there are many bumps and bruises along the way.

Watching Weeds via free satellite tv in Pennsylvania is awesome, and I love seeing every new show each week. I never know what might happen next because there are so many twists and turns that they keep you on the edge of your seat. When I feel like watching a good show, I turn to Showtime and watch Weeds.
