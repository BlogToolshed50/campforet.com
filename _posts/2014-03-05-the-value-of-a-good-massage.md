Long ago, trying to find an insurance company that would pay for chiropractic treatment was a losing endeavor. Chiropractic practitioners were once considered to have more in common with holistic healers than licensed medical personnel. Until recently, massage therapy and those who performed it were viewed by the medical and insurance establishments in much the same way.

Fortunately, gone are the days when massage therapy held the negative connotation of being a pseudo-science and brought to mind images of self-taught, out-call therapists with cheap portable massage tables and suspect skills. Massage therapists certainly still make out-calls, but changes in the way the profession is regulated have legitimized the industry and revitalized the image of those in the field. Today’s massage therapists are highly trained professionals whose work is widely accepted by the medical community. Though many work for themselves or as an employee of a private company, more and more are finding employment in medical facilities where their skills are in high demand.

Massage therapy programs are offered by many accredited colleges and universities across the nation, and graduates are encouraged to test for national certification. Those who pass the comprehensive test administered by the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork have the freedom to pursue the best job opportunities health care while those without national certification are generally self employed. In either case, the financial compensation is rising at a rapid rate.

As more people realize the therapeutic benefits of massage, its popularity and acceptance have grown. Surprisingly, young adults are the demographic that bring about the majority of business for self-employed massage therapists. This speaks volumes for the long term demand that those in the field will enjoy, as most who engage in massage therapy at a younger age are likely to continue enjoying its benefits well into their twilight years. By contrast, the elderly constitute the largest portion of those who seek massage therapy in a medical setting. As the baby boomer generation continues to age, the number of elderly requiring treatment will steadily increase.

Whether in a clinic, hospital, long term care facility, office, home or health club, people are starting to realize the value of a good massage. A massage therapist’s knowledge of anatomy and human musculature can make a world of difference to those who suffer from chronic back pain, spinal injuries and muscle tension. As a result, massage therapists are now finally being compensated at a rate commensurate with what they bring to the table, whether they bring the table or not.
