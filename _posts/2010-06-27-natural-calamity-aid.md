It is so sad that we are coming across lots of natural calamities like the one happened at Haiti, and China. While the developed countries with economic prosperity are able to tackle the issue on their own, many nations wait for the aide from others. In the case of Haiti earth quake, many governments, charitable and non-profit organizations from around the world began coordinating various types of humanitarian aid to help the Haitian people.

It is heartening to note that as much as $2.50 billion has been given to the rescue of the people at Haiti to come out of the earth quake issue until March 2010. Apart from the funding to give relief to the affected people, good amount of materials were also given by the nations like United States, UK, Canada Italy and Brazil.

Recently we observe so many east Asian countries are facing the wrath of nature by undergoing the impact of earth quake and flood. It is high time that an international body is created exclusively to tackle the issue of natural calamity. This entity should have a common fund contributed on regular basis by all the nations to meet out the eventuality. Such organization should bring together all the nations to discuss on the issue of environment to every such disasters in the future by following certain limit in the exploitation of the nature.
