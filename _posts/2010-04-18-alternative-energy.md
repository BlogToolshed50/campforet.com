Alternative Energy is to be scouted by those countries, who depend mainly on electricity and Petro products. The cost of oil is draining the exchequer of various nations. It is high time that the alternative sources of energy like solar energy, bio gas, wind energy and tidal energy are produced wherever the nature favours the same. Solar energy is available in abundance in the globe and it can be put in to best use in the field of rural electrification. Many hotels and the hospitals use the solar energy by having their own arrangement. In fact, the realty sector in different countries are coming out with projects, inclusive of solar energy units in the housing units to take care of the house hold requirement like lighting and cooking. This is not only cost saving, but also environmental friendly.
