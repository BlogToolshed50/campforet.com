Thank god for the San Diego P.I&#8217;s is getting great reviews from critics and should be another must see show for the network.

The show stars Donal Logue and Michael Raymond-James as unlicensed private investigators Hank Dolworth and Britt Pollack. Dolworth (Logue) is an ex-cop who reluctantly joins the private eye game with his buddy Pollack (Raymond-James). The show is supposed to be an homage to classic private eye shows of the past. From the network&#8217;s description, Hank and Britt are far from glamorous and even when they come out on top, they&#8217;re going to look ugly doing it (not to be taken literally). There&#8217;s something about flawed, multi-layered characters that attracts us &#8211; especially when they are underdogs (rooting for underdogs seems to be a dominant gene among homo sapiens).

I&#8217;ve been a fan of Logue&#8217;s since he played Eddie on &#8216;Felicity&#8217;. He was born to play misfit characters and this is right up his alley. His ability to play the same types of characters in different ways is astounding. He&#8217;ll go from being a romantic misfit on &#8216;Felicity&#8217;, to a fatherly misfit on &#8216;Grounded for Life&#8217;, make a left and become misfit doctor on &#8216;ER&#8217;, etc.,. I literally cannot wait to see him play a gritty misfit on &#8216;Terriers&#8217;.
