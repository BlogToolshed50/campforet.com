Niagara Falls seems to be the Canadian attraction and one of the most notorious waterfalls on the Earth. Canada receives more than 20 millions of tourists annually and the most of them get to Niagara Falls. The profits for Canada are really huge!
  
Niagara river connects two of the Great Lakes – Ontario and Eri and is a part of the border between Canada and USA. The waterfall is situated approximately in the middle of the river.
  
Waterfall consists of two parts – the American and the Canadian. They are separated by the Goat Island. Canadian part is more known. It is 792 wide and about 50 meters high. American part is much more narrow – about 300 meters. The height is approximately the same.
  
This natural miracle looks beautiful at any time of the year, but please remember, that Canadian winters are rather cold! If you are not afraid of the frost, you will have a delightful opportunity to contemplate stark waterfall in all its magnificence.
  
In spring it becomes colored with tulips and daffodils. In summer when it’s warm and sunny you often can watch a rainbow above waterfall.
  
One of the most exciting experiences is the trip to waterfall on the boat. It’s necessary to wear a raincoat because you get wet anyway.
  
Another way to get strong impressions is the Journey Behind the Falls. Lift takes you to three tunnels from where opens a breathtaking view to waterfalls. You can also admire Niagara from the air in helicopter.
  
Some prefer to enjoy a spectacular view of Niagara from the bridges – Rainbow Bridge is the most popular one.
  
The nearest big cities are Buffalo in USA and Toronto in Canada, but there is a city Niagara Falls just by the waterfall.
  
Attractions include Queen Victoria Park, adjacent to the Canadian Falls; the historical museum at Lundy&#8217;s Lane, site of a brutal battle between American and British forces in 1814; Skylon Tower and Pavilion, containing a revolving restaurant and an observation deck overlooking the falls; and of course, Casino Niagara.
  
Above the waterfall itself the place also boasts rich fauna. Niagara shores are inhabited by 19 kinds of gulls. Niagara Parks Butterfly Conservatory is a home for 50 kinds of butterflies from all over the world.
