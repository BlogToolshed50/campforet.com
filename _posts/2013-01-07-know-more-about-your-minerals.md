One should know that the mineral is a natural occurring solid who&#8217;s formation occurs through geological processes which has a characteristic chemical composition with large atomic structure and specific physical properties. To understand mineral users can see rock which don not need any specific chemical composition. Minerals range in composition from the pure elements to the simple salts to the extent of very complex silicates along with many known forms. So the readers of minerals is also called as mineralogy.

In order to classified as a pure mineral, the substances should be in a solid state carrying crystalline structure. Minerals should reflects as a homogeneous substance carrying a defined chemical composition. As per the International Mineralogical Association the definition of mineral goes just like that defined in 1995 : a mineral is an element or chemical compound appearing crystalline and obtained from the geological processes. The chemical composition differs many end members of the mineral system. Mineral-like substances which do not shows their properties of minerals are defined as mineraloids. Many other natural-occurring substances like non minerals. Minerals do get its name as per the usage in varied fields like industrial minerals used in the market and commercially as mined materials .

Crystal structure shows the ability of influencing the mineral&#8217;s physical properties. Diamond and graphite is having the same composition where graphite is found to be highly soft and diamond as the hardest of all famous minerals. As per the reports of the International Mineralogical Association there are 4000 minerals present in the nature. In order to know more about minerals people should read magazines and booklets in order to get benefited from these minerals source. Classifying the minerals is not an easy work as it ranges from simple to very difficult task. So one should understand that mineral is identified because of many physical properties. In several cases, minerals are shown as more complex chemical and X-ray diffraction analysis.
