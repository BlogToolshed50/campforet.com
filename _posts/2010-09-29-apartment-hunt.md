Guest post written by Simon Darron

When I first moved to New York City, I lived on my friend Carl&#8217;s couch, so he told me a lot about what I should look for in an apartment and what was a sure sign that I didn&#8217;t want a place. With his help, I found a place to move into after about a month that I really liked.

Once I moved in he also suggested that I laundromat because I had never used a public one all through college. I just always used the laundry room in the basement of my dorm. He warned me to not leave my clothes unattended no matter what, that people might otherwise put their clothes in with mine or something if I did that. I was really tempted to do this because there&#8217;s a laundromat right next door, but took his advice.

It&#8217;s a different world here than from Indiana.
