When I read the news in a newspaper regarding the frauds that are taking place using e-mail and mobile, it led to the fear whether the so-called technological gadgets are really worth owning and using. Of late many banks frauds are taking place through the net banking where the money is siphoned off from the accounts if gullible account holders.

The fraudsters are able to create the web site similar to the one created by the banks and cheat the account holders by calling for the id and the password in the pretext of changing the same. Recent events are also disclosing such a Cyber crimes in the field of job offer. E-mail ids of leading companies are imitated and the job offer is made on lucrative terms. The applicant is demanded with the hefty sums as the processing charges for the visa and other incidental charges and ultimately he is duped.

In the present day world such attacks by the Cyber criminals have intensified recently. It is fuelled by the growing use of the internet and mobile phones and the general desperation caused by an economic downturn globally that has left millions jobless. It is advisable that we are cautious of such mails and wrong communication to avoid the chance of becoming the victims of such frauds.
