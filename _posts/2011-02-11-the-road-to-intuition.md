Have you had that experience when all of a sudden you just had this huge hunch that something is about to happen, and to your surprise, that intuition was eventually translated to reality? 

When you feel strongly about something without logical basis to it, that&#8217;s called intuition. It comes in three impressions: clairvoyance or &#8220;the third eye&#8221;, sensing clearly and feeling through listening. 

Clairvoyance is when your eye goes beyond what it can see. This is when you know what is happening somewhere.

Sensing clearly is basically what we refer to as &#8220;hunch&#8221; or &#8220;gut feel.&#8221; This is the time when you are overwhelmed with a feeling and you can&#8217;t explain it and all you can say is &#8220;I just know.&#8221;

On the other hand, feeling through listening or clairaudience is being able to &#8220;listen&#8221; between the lines. Intuition also happens at times when a certain sound, whatever it is &#8211; be it a car&#8217;s honk or a bird&#8217;s twitting &#8211; ushers in an intense feeling.

They say only a number of people are gifted with intuition. Astrologers even insist that people born under the Scorpio or Pisces signs are naturally intuitive it almost borders on E.S.P. But studies have been sprouting left and right that proclaim that anyone can develop intuition.

Why the need to develop intuition, you ask? Why not let your emotional and psychological state as it is? First and foremost, intuition promotes good communication. It makes you more sensitive to the people around you; it often keeps you from hurting those you love because you are intuitive enough to understand them. Intuition also makes you far more creative than ever. Intuition means releasing more creative juices for any means of expression. Lastly, intuition has a healing power. This healing power is not in the physical sense, but in delving deep into your soul to eradicate some negative energy buried in it.
