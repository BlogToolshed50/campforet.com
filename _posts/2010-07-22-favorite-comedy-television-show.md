This guest post from Errol Chang

direct tv, i can&#8217;t look away. I am transported into a half hour of the casts&#8217; amusing banter.

The show is about Ted Mosby, a hip and hopelessly romantic protagonist, and his group of twenty something friends and their engaging lives in NYC. Every character, from the extremely Canadian Robin Scherbatsky, to the womanizing, suit wearing, hilarity that is Barney Stinson. Then there&#8217;s the adorable perfect couple that is Marshall and Lily, they all have their distinct place in making this ensemble work. Besides being incredibly likeable, the show manages to be unpretentious and really relatable. Barney is responsible for many of the &#8216;LOL&#8217; moments of the series, but it&#8217;s Ted&#8217;s continuous search for love, that is the real highlight of the show. Ted&#8217;s everlong stumbling through the maze of serial dating in search of a future wife, is told pretty poignantly through narration. He keeps his heart on his sleeve, and his friends near and dear. So i keep rooting for the good guy, watching, and loving this show. No matter how far off he is from ever meeting &#8216;Mrs. Right&#8217;.
